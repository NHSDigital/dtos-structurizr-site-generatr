This is a fork of a great work done (here)[https://github.com/avisi-cloud/structurizr-site-generatr]

This fork really focuses on putting the content into a nhsuk styled version of the C4 diagrams.

The majority of the repo functionality has maintained the same, apart from the styling

The use of this repository is primarily to support the generation of the c4 diagrams used in this (repository)[https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-solution-architecture]

It is invoked as part of the pipeline and will output a static website into this location - https://nhsdigital.github.io/dtos-solution-architecture/structurizr/site/master/
